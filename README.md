# Graphiczizer
A randomized video generator that uses `node-canvas` and Three.js (TODO) and makes videos in .KRA files which you can edit in Krita.

Don't expect this to work. Seriously.

Made this as, unsurprisingly, a yet another silly project. This one tries to turn animations to .KRA files programmatically. All without human interference.

Compression and tiles are really hard to implement, but if a group of programmers called KDE barely implemented their own image format, then there's no chance for me alone.

Proudly made in Node.
